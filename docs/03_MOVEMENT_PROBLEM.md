# Movement Problem

Status: living document.

## Core problem

The immediate challenge is not route learning.

The immediate challenge is understanding whether QuakeWorld bunnyjumping can be expressed as a controllable, measurable, and eventually learnable movement policy inside the KTX/Frogbot architecture.

## Project-level goal

The goal is not:

`Can Frogbots bunnyhop?`

The goal is:

`Can Frogbots become believable stand-ins for real players?`

Bunnyjumping is currently the most visible bottleneck toward that goal.

## What we believe today

- Frogbots move through real server commands.
- KTX converts bot intent into `forwardmove`, `sidemove`, `upmove`, button presses, angles, and impulses.
- Server physics remain engine-native.
- MVD recording remains engine-native.

## What MVDs can and cannot teach us

MVDs are server-side recordings of game state and events.

They can help us observe:

- player position over time
- derived velocity
- route/area movement
- item, damage, frag, weapon, and state context
- view angles or aim when available through parser/fusion outputs

But MVDs generally do not provide clean normal player usercmd labels:

- exact key presses
- exact mouse deltas
- exact `forwardmove`
- exact `sidemove`
- exact jump button timing

This means learning from Milton or other elite players is probably not simple supervised learning from input labels.

The likely problem is inverse control or engine-in-loop optimization:

`observed elite movement trace -> legal server command policy that produces similar movement`

## Movement literacy before route tricks

Do not start with hard trick routes.

Before high-value DM2 routes such as high RL to quad, RA secret exits, or big-to-tele variants, the bot must first learn movement literacy:

- accelerate into bunnyjumping
- preserve speed across repeated jumps
- alternate strafe/yaw appropriately
- time jumps on landing
- steer without overfitting to a route file
- recover when speed, angle, or timing is wrong

## Frobodm2 vs stock DM2

Use `frobodm2` for the first smoke test if it is the easiest way to prove the lab loop works, because the BSP and Frogbot route file are known to exist.

But `frobodm2` is not the final movement target.

The first real movement target is stock DM2 big room, because it is real target geometry while still open enough to isolate bunnyjumping before route-specific tricks.

## NotebookLM-style force-bunnyhop patches

A crude patch such as:

- always jump whenever moving
- globally enable air-rotation/curljump logic
- lower the ground-speed threshold everywhere

may be useful as a lab probe.

It should not be treated as the solution.

The real target is a movement mode or controller with:

- start conditions
- stop conditions
- tactical permission
- speed/yaw targets
- failure recovery
- skill variation
- human-like imperfection

## What is not yet proven

- Whether movement can be cleanly replaced without rewriting the bot stack.
- Whether elite movement can be learned from MVD-derived evidence.
- Whether route logic and movement logic are sufficiently decoupled.
- Whether KTX/Frogbots should remain the substrate or be replaced by a new bot architecture.

## Working hypothesis

The largest visible realism gap is movement.

The largest visible movement gap is bunnyjumping.

Therefore movement is the first laboratory target.
