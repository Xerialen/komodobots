# Agent Instructions

This file is the shared instruction contract for all coding agents working in this repository.

Tool-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md` and `codex.md` should stay thin and point back here. Do not let them drift into separate project instructions.

Repo-specific autonomous agent cards live in `agents/`. They are operational role prompts only; this file remains authoritative if instructions conflict.

## Read order

Before making changes, read:

1. `docs/00_VISION_AND_NORTH_STAR.md`
2. `docs/01_PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
3. `docs/02_SOURCE_MAP.md`
4. `codex/START_HERE.md` if working through Codex

## North star

Every task must contribute evidence toward this question:

> Can QuakeWorld bots become realistic enough to act as believable substitutes for real players?

Bunnyjumping, DM2, KTX, Frogbots, MVD analysis, route learning, and movement controllers are not end goals. They are experiments designed to answer that larger question.

## Current hypothesis

KTX/Frogbots may be usable as a server-native bot shell while replacing or enhancing the movement brain.

This is unproven.

The first project objective is to build a repeatable lab that can prove or disprove this hypothesis.

## Documentation rules

Documentation is a first-class deliverable.

Any meaningful change to code, scripts, configs, experiments, architecture, environment, or assumptions must update at least one relevant document.

Use this routing:

- New source or reference -> update `docs/02_SOURCE_MAP.md`
- Movement discovery -> update `docs/03_MOVEMENT_PROBLEM.md`
- Lab setup change -> update `docs/05_HEADLESS_TEST_ENV.md`
- MVD/data pipeline discovery -> update `docs/06_DATA_AND_MVD_PIPELINE.md`
- Experiment result -> update `docs/07_FINDINGS_LOG.md`
- Architecture/project decision -> update `docs/08_DECISION_LOG.md`

## Before finishing any task

Answer these in the final message or commit summary:

- What changed?
- What evidence was produced?
- Which docs were updated?
- If no docs were updated, why not?
- What is the next smallest useful experiment?

## Do not do these first

Do not start by training Milton.
Do not start by rewriting Frogbots.
Do not start by implementing a final bunnyjump controller.
Do not treat speed alone as success.
Do not treat bunnyjumping as the project goal.

First build the laboratory.

## Preferred working style

Make small, reversible changes.
Prefer measurement before optimization.
Prefer source-grounded claims over guesses.
Record uncertainty explicitly.
Keep the larger FantasyQuake / Megalodon Milton fork visible in documentation.
